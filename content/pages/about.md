Title: About

Hi, I'm a hacker originally from the San Francisco Bay Area. I'm currently living in London.

Some of you may have known me by other names and handles over the years, but "ArcaneNibble" and "R" are the current ones. `rqou` is retained for backwards compatibility, and all other identities are now deprecated.

I have a wide variety of interests and do many different things, including:

* information security (formerly a member of the Paranoids team at Yahoo!)
* reverse engineering (initial reverse engineering of the Apple M1 Bluetooth module for Asahi Linux)
* FPGAs and electronics (reverse engineered the Altera/Intel MAX V in order to write F/OSS tooling)
* embedded systems (#badgelife, writing firmware)
* cosplay? (WIP)

I attended UC Berkeley and have MEng and BS degrees in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.

Don't hesitate to try to get in touch with me! If I haven't responded, please try again a few more times - I tend to forget about these sorts of things.

I'm looking for work! See my [CV](/cv.html)
