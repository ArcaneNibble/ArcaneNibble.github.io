Hi, I'm a human (creature?) who goes by "R" or @<small>Arcane</small><span style="font-family: 'IBM VGA 9x16'">Nibble</span>

If it helps you form a better picture of me, I go by _she/they_. 我会讲中文。廣東話都得。

I'm originally from the San Francisco Bay Area, but I'm currently living in London.

I'm very experienced with a *wide* range of technologies, including but not limited to cybersecurity, embedded systems, electronics, as well as general software engineering. If you are interested in that, you can either read all about it on my [CV](/cv.html), or you can contact me using any of the methods in the sidebar.

I'm looking for work! I am also open to contracting.

This website is ⚠under construction⚠, but it currently contains [a blog](/archives.html).

I used to be known as `rqou`, but this is a legacy interface for backwards-compatibility only.
